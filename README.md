# orhan-albayati-web-project

This is the final project in the course Web Development Frontend on the .NET Developer programme at Teknikh√∂gskolan

Site hosted on GitHub pages: https://orhan92.github.io/orhan-albayati-web-project/

OKTA AUthorization is direced to local URI so you will not be able to login from GitHub pages. Also There is some kind of error displaying images attached in the project on GitHub Pages. So from now on I will work on local to avoid small bugs.

**_CONCLUSION_**
I have made a few "re-directions" in this project. With that said I mean that I was heading towards one course (endgoal) but figured the day after that I might want to change this course into something else. Therefore, when you read the logbook you might notice that I'm re-directing my focus. That is, because I realize that there are better solutions than the one I previously came up with.
